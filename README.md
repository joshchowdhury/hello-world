# hello-world
Daaahhhhhh
I am currently a second-year management (BBA) student. My passion for managing projects brought me to the School of Techno India University, Kolkata. Last semester I completed the Foundation program, which covers Cumulative Assignment, Business organization, Principles of management, etc.
The most valuable lesson I have learned from TIU has been the importance of the market before moving into different other aspects of management. My classes have provided me with great insights for a future career in Digital marketing and project management.
This year I have mastered ' The Foundation of Project Management by Google'. I continue to build skills in management. Next year, I hope to complete my course, and find internships this year that will provide real-life experience and important management skills and strategies.
